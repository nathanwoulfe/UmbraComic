# UmbraComic - speeding up the backoffice by dumping webfonts

Feel like your Umbraco backoffice is bogged down and loading slowly? Save an easy 400kb by not downloading webfonts.

Lato barely looks any different to the system defaults. You won't even miss it.

Open Sans? Pfft. Let's go sans Open Sans.

As an extra special treat, UmbraComic will update your backoffice to use Comic Sans.

It's elegant, much-maligned, and actually provides better readability for users with dyslexia (approximately 10% of people).
